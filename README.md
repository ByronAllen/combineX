# combineX | Merge all CSVs from Single Directory 

You can download the program here: https://github.com/ByronAllen/combineX. See the green clone or download button. Click and select download ZIP. This will be the easiest route for now. Once you’ve unzipped in your Desktop go to your Terminal (command + space bar) then type Terminal. From there do the following:

cd ~/Desktop/combineX # Moving you into the combineX directory \n
mkdir data # This creates a folder called ‘data’, and your CSVs here \n
mkdir output # This creates a folder called ‘output’ \n
brew install pip # This may break if you do not have brew, but many Macs have it by default \n
pip install pandas # The combineX program requires this \n
python run.py # Follow the prompts \n

All your CSVs have to be the same length and have to have a column that you designate.
